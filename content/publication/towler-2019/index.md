abstract: Facial image comparison practitioners compare images of unfamiliar faces
  and decide whether or not they show the same person. Given the importance of these
  decisions for national security and criminal investigations, practitioners attend
  training courses to improve their face identification ability. However, these courses
  have not been empirically validated so it is unknown if they improve accuracy. Here,
  we review the content of eleven professional training courses offered to staff at
  national security, police, intelligence, passport issuance, immigration and border
  control agencies around the world. All reviewed courses include basic training in
  facial anatomy and prescribe facial feature (or 'morphological') comparison. Next,
  we evaluate the effectiveness of four representative courses by comparing face identification
  accuracy before and after training in novices (n = 152) and practitioners (n = 236).
  We find very strong evidence that short (1-hour and half-day) professional training
  courses do not improve identification accuracy, despite 93% of trainees believing
  their performance had improved. We find some evidence of improvement in a 3-day
  training course designed to introduce trainees to the unique feature-by-feature
  comparison strategy used by facial examiners in forensic settings. However, observed
  improvements are small, inconsistent across tests, and training did not produce
  the qualitative changes associated with examiners' expertise. Future research should
  test the benefits of longer examination-focussed training courses and incorporate
  longitudinal approaches to track improvements caused by mentoring and deliberate
  practice. In the absence of evidence that training is effective, we advise agencies
  to explore alternative evidence-based strategies for improving the accuracy of face
  identification decisions.
